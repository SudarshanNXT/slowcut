                "overview": "My Way is more than a song, it's a major score that has crossed the boundaries of eras and generations. An anthem that has become a part of ourselves and of music history. My Way is one of the most covered songs in the world, from Sid Vicious to Tom Jones, from Nina Simone to Pavarotti. Yet many people are unaware that it was conceived in France, by the pool of Claude François' private hotel, in the summer of 1967, and that a succession of chance encounters and sleepless nights guided it across the Atlantic to the man who was to make it a legend. Like a biopic, this documentary recounts the birth of a myth and how a song entered the pantheon of pop culture.",

                "overview": "The true story of formidable Christy Martin, who rose to fame as America’s most successful female boxer in the 1990s. A naturally gifted fighter, Christy’s life transformed in 1989 when she met her manager and later husband, Jim Martin. Breaking boundaries, she became the first woman to sign with iconic promoter Don King and the only female boxer to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Christy’s charisma, good looks, and unwavering resilience in the ring won her a wide fan base and propelled her to become welterweight champion. Behind this well-honed public persona, Christy tackled personal demons, toxic relationships, and an attempt on her life, proving that a fighter’s hardest-won victories aren’t always in the ring.",
